    Conditional statement is an block of code that will be executed by
    the basis of their conditions.If particular condition meet the executed conditions then it
    will executed.
    
    Different methods of conditional statement:-
    1-If Statement
       If condition is true them code of block will be executed
    syntax:-
     if(condition){
        // If condition met code will be executed.
    }

    example:- let a = 6;
             if(a % 2 === 0){
                console.log("even Number")
             }
             if(a % 2 !== 0){
                console.log("Odd number")
             }

    2-If-Else Statement
    It will perform a condition based on the output 
    of the code block.
    
    suntax:-
    if(){
    // Execute when condition is true
    }else{
        // Execute when condition is true

    }

    example:- let num = 10;
    if(num >= 8){
        console.log("You can come to ride")
    }
    else{
        console.log("You cannot come to rides")
    }

    3-Else if Statement
    This will handle multiple conditions at once based on their conditions

    const value = 0;

    if(value>18){
    console.log("Positive value')
    }
    else if(value>18){
    console.log("negative value')
    }
    else{
        console.log("Zero value")
    }


    4-Switch  Case Statement

      When we have to write a multiple statement in an conditions 
      switch case is more preferred way.

      syntax:-
      switch(expression){
      case1;
      statement;
      break;
      case2;
      statement;
      break;
      case3;
      statement;
      break;
      default;
      statement;
      }
     
      example:-
      const marks = 90;
      let Grade;

      switch(true){
        case marks  >= 90;
        Grade = "Grade A"
        break;

        case marks  >= 70;
        Grade = "Grade B"
        break;

        case marks  >= 60;
        Grade = "Grade C"
        break;
        
        default;
        Grade = "Grade E"        
      }

    
    5-Ternary Operator

      It is derived by ? this Symbol when we use .
      example:- 
      syntax:-

      let value = n;
      console.log(`${value>n}`)

      example:-

      const age = 18;
      console.log(`${age>18} "You Can come to the party" : "You cannot come to the party "`)      
      console.log(age)
