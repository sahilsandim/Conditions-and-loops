There are varieties of loops we use in javscript:-
1]for loop
  for loop is used when we have a run a loop based on condition
  -these loop has 3 conditions 
  1]Initialization
  2]condition
  3]Increment/Decrement
  for(let i=0; i<18; i++){
    console.log(i);
    i++;
  }

2]while loop
  This loop is based on conditions if condition is true then it will be executed
  otherwise it will not executed.
suntax:-
while(condition){
  loop executed..
}

example:-
let i = 0;
while (i<=25) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

3]do - while loop
 These loop is executed once before changing the conditions

 let i = 0;
 do{
 i++;
 console.log(i)
 }while(i<5)

5]for-of loop
  loops through value of the object
  const a = [1,2,3,4,5]
  for(const value of a){
    a+=
    console.log(a)
  }

6]for-in loop
  loops through keys of an object
  const obj = {1:name, 2:value}
  for(const v in obj){
    console.log(obj)
  }
